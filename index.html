    <div class='description'>services for IRC networks</div>
    <p>Kythera is a set of services for IRC networks. Kythera is extremely extensible
    and is not limited to providing a specific set of services such as <code>NickServ</code>,
    <code>ChanServ</code> vs. Undernet-style <code>X</code>, etc. You can configure the service to offer
    pretty much anything you want. If it’s not there, you can easily add support for
    it if you know Ruby.</p>
    
    <p>Ruby also brings us to my next point. Many people have told me that IRC services
    must be implemented in C in order to have any hope of keeping up with medium-
    to large-sized networks. I disagree. I actually spend a good amount of time
    benchmarking various Ruby implementations to make sure this wasn’t a silly
    project. Having previously implemented services in C myself, I think
    I’m quite qualified to judge the situation. In most cases, Ruby was reasonably
    competitive with, and sometimes faster than traditional services written in C.</p>
    
    <p>Most people running ircd are sysadmins that may know some dynamic languages
    like Python and Ruby, but probably not static languages like C. It’s my hope
    that Kythera can compete on performance, and obliterate the competition on
    ease-of-use and ease-of-hacking.</p>
    
    <h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>
    
    <p>This application has the following requirements:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>ruby – mri ~&gt; 1.8; mri ~&gt; 1.9; rbx ~&gt; 1.2</li>
      <li>sqlite ~&gt; 3.0</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This application requires the following RubyGems:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>rake ~&gt; 0.8</li>
      <li>sequel ~&gt; 3.23</li>
      <li>sqlite3 ~&gt; 1.3</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Rake is required for testing and other automated tasks. Sequel and sqlite3 are
    required for database management. These gems are widely available and should
    not be a problem.</p>
    
    <p>If you want to run the unit tests you’ll also need <code>riot ~&gt; 0.12</code> and run
    <code>rake test</code> from your terminal. If you want to run the benchmarks you’ll
    need <code>benchmark_suite ~&gt; 0.8.0</code> and probably <code>ffi ~&gt; 1.0.9</code>.</p>
    
    <h2 id="ircds">IRCds</h2>
    
    <p>Kythera can, in theory, support any IRCd. So long as a protocol module has
    been written, your IRCd should work. Kythera ships with support for several
    IRCds. These include:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>ircd-ratbox (tested with 2.2.9)</li>
      <li>charybdis (tested with 3.2.1)</li>
      <li>UnrealIRCd (tested with 3.2.8.1)</li>
      <li>InspIRCd (tested with 1.2.8)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Other TS6-based IRCds may work. For now, the TS6 module only provides support
    for TS6-only networks. If you link a non-TS6 server, Kythera will ignore it.</p>
