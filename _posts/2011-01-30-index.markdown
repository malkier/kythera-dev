Kythera is a set of services for TSora-based IRC networks. Kythera is
extremely extensible and is not limited to providing a specific set of
services such as `NickServ`, `ChanServ` vs. Undernet-style `X`, etc. You can
configure the service to offer pretty much anything you want. If it's not there,
you can easily add support for it if you know Ruby.

Ruby also brings us to my next point. Many people have told me that IRC services
must be implemented in C in order to have any hope of keeping up with medium-
to large-sized networks. I disagree. I actually spend a good amount of time
benchmarking various Ruby implementations to make sure this wasn't a silly
project. Having previously implemented services in C myself, I think
I'm quite qualified to judge the situation. In most cases, Ruby was reasonably
competitive with, and sometimes faster than traditional services written in C.

Most people running ircd are sysadmins that may know some dynamic languages
like Python and Ruby, but probably not static languages like C. It's my hope
that Kythera can compete on performance, and obliterate the competition on
ease-of-use and ease-of-hacking.
