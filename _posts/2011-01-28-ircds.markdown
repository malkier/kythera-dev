## IRCds ##

Kythera can, in theory, support any IRCd. So long as a protocol module has
been written, your IRCd should work. Kythera ships with support for several
IRCds. These include:

  * ircd-ratbox (tested with 2.2.9)
  * charybdis (tested with 3.2.1)
  * UnrealIRCd (tested with 3.2.8.1)
  * InspIRCd (tested with 1.2.8)

Other TS6-based IRCds may work. For now, the TS6 module only provides support
for TS6-only networks. If you link a non-TS6 server, Kythera will ignore it.
