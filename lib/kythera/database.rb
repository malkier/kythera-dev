        # Asserts that arguments match a certain class, and raises errors if
        # they do not. The arguments are passed as return values from a block
        # which makes certain assumptions for how the variables would be named
        # in the scope of the method. For instance, an "account" variable should
        # be an Account object.
        #
        # The simplest way to use the method is to pass a block which returns a
        # single Symbol (containing the variable name) or Class (the class of
        # which the variable should be a type). The earlier stated assumptions
        # hold in this case. You can also pass an array (which can mix Symbol
        # and Class elements) which makes the same assumptions about each
        # individual element.
        #
        # The more explicit mechanism of declaring variables using a hash should
        # be reserved for when variables aren't named according to their type.
        # The hash should be formatted with keys being the variable names, and
        # values being the classes.
        #
        # Only the "returning a single Symbol" method of checking types requires
        # that the argument be a Symbol, all other methods can take a String,
        # Class, Symbol, or whatever other representation can be converted to
        # a string that describes the name and/or type.
        #
        # This method will only validate arguments if $config.logging is set to
        # :debug, as it's designed to help in writing code. By the time it's
        # running in a production environment, the kinks requiring this code
        # should be addressed.

        # @private
        # @param [Proc] block Block returning argument types
        # @raise [ArgumentError] If arguments don't match type
        #
        # @example Using a single Symbol class to define an argument
        #   def drop(account)
        #       assert { :account } # verify account is an Account object
        #       account.delete # perform an Account-specific action
        #   end
