module Database
    #
    # This module creates, reads, and deletes memorandums sent between users of
    # the system. It assumes everyone wants the ability to send and receive
    # memos, and does not allow for blocking users (currently). There are only a
    # few fields to a memo: to, from, unread, topic, and memo.
    #
    module MemorandumService

        # not be used directly.
